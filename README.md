Porting Pearls - P5 to P6 Gotchas
====================

This repo contains useful tips and tricks for porting Perl5 code into Perl6, gained through the ordeal of porting actual CPAN modules\* to Perl6. 

This guide is written in Github markdown and comes in the following flavours:

 * [General](General.md)
 * [Regex](Regex.md)
 * [XS and NativeCall](XS.md)
 * [Classes, Objects, Methods](OO.md)
 * [Operators](Operators.md)
 * [Idioms](Idioms.md)
 * ...
 
Contributions from the P5 and P6 communities are more than welcome!

\* The modules in question are [Lingua::EN::Sentence](https://github.com/dginev/perl6-Lingua-EN-Sentence), [XML::LibXML](https://github.com/dginev/perl6-XML-LibXML)(in progress...), and more to come.
